      <p>Hi! My name is Kashina. I created this website during a Summer Immersion Program hosted by Girls Who Code. I wanted to make this website to spread awareness about the dangers of the overturning of Roe Vs. Wade and give reasources to those heavily affected by it. I believe every women should have the right to decide what to do with their bodies.  You cannot take abortion away by criminalizing it, you just make it unsafe. Many poor women, women of color, women without advantages are being put at risk and many will die. We must acknowledge this and fight to save these women. We can't let them down. If you want to know more about me, check out my <a href="https://kashinas-personal-website.kashina1206.repl.co/">personal website</a>!</p>
