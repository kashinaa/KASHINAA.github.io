      <h2>What exactly is abortion and why do people get them?</h2>
      <p>Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. Many people have abortions because they cannot afford to raise a child, they aren't ready to raise a child, they are victims of sexual assult or incest, having a child is a risk to their health, etc.  Many people have various reasons for getting an abortion and they are all valid.  
     </p>

      <h2>Why do we need access to safe abortions?</h2>
      <p>Ending a pregnancy is a common desicion millions of have people make and regardless of whether or not abortion is legal, people still require access to abortion services. When provided by a trained health-care provider in sanitary conditions, abortions are one of the safest medical procedures available. But when the government restricts access to safe abortions, people are forced to turn to unsafe methods such as pumping toxic mixtures into the body or trying to break the amniotic sac inside the womb with a sharp object. These unsafe methods can put the person's life in danger and potentially kill them. Criminalizing abortion doesn't stop abortions from happening - it just increases the number of unsafe abortions.
      </p>

      <p>Deaths and injuries caused by unsafe abortions are preventable. The World Health Organization has noted that one of the first steps to avoiding maternal deaths and injuries is by ensuring that people have access to sex education, effective contraceptives, and safe and legal abortions. Evidence shows that abortion rates are higher in countries where there limited access to contraceptives. However, in countries where people,including adolescents, have access to modern contraceptive methods and where sex education is available and there is access to safe and legal abortions, abortion rates are lower. </p>

      <h2>Change is coming.</h2>
      <h3>Many countries are starting their laws to allow greater access to abortion. </h3>

      <p>In the past 25 years, more than 50 countries have changed their laws to allow greater access to abortion and recognized that safe abortions play a vital role in protecting women's lives and health. But the fight is far from over. Access to abortion is linked to protecting and upholding the human rights of women, girls and others who can become pregnant, and thus for achieving social and gender justice. It is essential that laws relating to abortion respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of pregnant people and not force them to turn to unsafe abortions.</p>
